# Winkeng
Stream capture software for the Lenkeng HDMI extenders, for Windows. Forked from bp2008's work at https://hdmiextender.codeplex.com which in turn is heavily based on danman's reverse engineering efforts at https://danman.eu/blog/reverse-engineering-lenkeng-hdmi-over-ip-extender/. 99% of the current work is done by them.

# Requirements
* Recent WinPcap http://www.winpcap.org/
